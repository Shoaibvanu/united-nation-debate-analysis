Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \\nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \\n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \\ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \\nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \\nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \\nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \\nother. \\nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \\nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \\nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \\nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's \\nThe President returned to the Chair. \\n\\n\\\"broad, sunlit uplands\\\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \\nchillingly wrote, \\\"Darkness at Noon\\\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \\nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \\nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \\nbecame conflict's captive. \\nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \\nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \\nwar's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \\nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \\ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \\nbanished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \\ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \\nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \\nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \\nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \\nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \\nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \\ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \\nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \\nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \\nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \\ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \\nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \\n\\nWith the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \\nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \\ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \\nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \\nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \\nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \\nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \\ncommunity. \\nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \\nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \\npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \\nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \\nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \\nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \\nconflict and war. \\nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \\nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \\ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \\nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and \\npreventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \\neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \\ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \\nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \\nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \\nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \\ninternational peace and order. \\n\\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \\nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \\neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \\nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \\nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \\nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \\nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \\nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \\npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \\n \\nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \\npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \\nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \\nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \\nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \\nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \\ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \\nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \\nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \\ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \\npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \\nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \\nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \\nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \\npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \\nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \\nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \\nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \\ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \\nin communism's catacomb. \\nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \\ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \\ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \\nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \\nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \\ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \\n \\nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \\norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \\nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \\na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \\nEurasia, but across the globe. \\nI welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the \\nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \\nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \\nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \\nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \\nSecretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \\nareas. \\nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \\nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \\npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \\nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \\nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \\nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \\ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \\na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \\ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \\nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \\nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \\n\\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \\norganizations. \\nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \\npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \\nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \\nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \\ncrisis. \\nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \\nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \\nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \\nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \\nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \\nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \\nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \\npeace-keeping. \\nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \\naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \\nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \\ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \\npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for \\nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \\nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \\nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \\nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \\nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \\njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \\npeace-keeping operations. \\n\\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \\nplay a part. \\nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \\ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \\npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \\narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \\nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \\ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \\nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \\nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \\nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \\nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \\nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \\nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \\noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \\nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \\nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \\nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \\nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \\nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \\nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \\nsecurity in this new era. \\nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \\ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \\n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \\n \\nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \\nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \\nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \\nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \\n\\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \\nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \\nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \\nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \\nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \\nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \\nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \\nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \\nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \\nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \\nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \\\"clubs\\\", the nuclear-suppliers \\ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \\nNations specialized agencies. \\nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \\nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \\nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \\nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \\nour non-proliferation goals. \\nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \\nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \\nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \\nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \\ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \\n\\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \\njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \\nagenda. \\nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \\nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \\ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \\ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \\nother nations participate in this global protection system. \\nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \\nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \\ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \\ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \\nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \\npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \\nthis new era. \\nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \\nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \\nI affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and \\nenhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \\nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \\nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \\nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \\nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \\neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \\nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \\n\\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \\nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \\nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \\nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \\nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \\nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \\nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \\nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \\ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \\nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \\nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \\nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \\nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \\nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \\nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \\nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \\nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \\nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \\nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \\ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \\nbetter a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \\nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \\npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \\nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \\n\\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \\nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \\nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \\nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \\nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \\nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \\nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \\nreform. \\nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \\nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \\nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \\nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \\ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \\nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \\ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \\nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \\nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \\nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \\nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \\npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \\nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \\nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \\nend one era and begin another. \\nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \\nthrough greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. \\n\\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \\nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \\nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \\nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \\ncommunity of democratic nations. \\n\\nAnd in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was \\nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \\neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \\ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \\nanything at all that appears new and different. \\nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall \\nbecause we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so \\ninterconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, \\nthat to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and \\ndefeat. \\nAt the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more \\nsecure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children \\nand our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war \\nand for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive \\neven during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future \\nreal, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United \\nNations. \\nThank you and may God bless you all. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"47\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1992\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'I welcome everyone to New York. It is a profound honour to stand here in my home city as a representative of the American people to address the people of the world.\\nAs millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in the Hall who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.\\nFortunately, the United States of America has done very well since election day, last 8 November. The stock market is at an all-time high. That is a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time, and it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defence. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.\\nFor more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before the Assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.\\nBut each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this organ not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humankind. Authoritarian Powers seek to collapse the values, systems and alliances that have prevented conflict and tilted the world towards freedom since the Second World War. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons and people; force dislocation and mass migration; and threaten our borders. New forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.\\nTo put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear.\\nThis institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It is based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe, based on the three beautiful pillars of peace, sovereignty and security, and prosperity. The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, “Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations”.\\nThe success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its Members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world.\\nWe do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of Government, but we do expect all nations to uphold the two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. That is the beautiful vision of this institution, and it is the foundation for cooperation and success. Strong sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. Strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.\\nIn America, we seek not to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. That timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law. The greatest part of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are “We the people”. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign.\\nI was elected not to take power but to give power to the American people, where it belongs. In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our Government’s first duty is to its people, to our citizens; to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just as the leaders of the countries present will always and should always put their countries first. All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation State remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies, but we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into one-sided deals where the United States gets nothing in return.\\nAs long as I hold my office, I will defend America’s interest above all else; but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it is in everyone’s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great Hall. America’s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside our allies. From the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia, it is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead we helped to build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity of all.\\nFor the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values. That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in the Hall. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. Will we slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?\\nIf we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfil our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow. And, just as the founders of this organ intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.\\nThe scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.\\nNo one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more. We were all witness to the regime’s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator’s brother, using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies.\\nIf that were not twisted enough, now North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able but, hopefully, that will not be necessary. That is what the United Nations is all about. That is what the United Nations is for. Let us see how they do.\\nIt is time for North Korea to realize that denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-to-nothing votes, adopting hard-hitting resolutions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I would like to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. I thank all who were involved, but we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behaviour.\\nWe face that decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime — one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations represented in the Hall today. The Iranian Government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue State whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are in fact its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hizbullah and other terrorists who kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbours.\\nThat wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar Al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue such destabilizing activities, while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear programme.\\nThe Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States — and I do not think that the Assembly has heard the last of it, believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s Government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all the Americans and citizens of other nations whom they have unjustly detained. Above all, Iran’s Government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbours.\\nThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most. That is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nation’s proud roots as a centre of civilization, culture and wealth, where people can be happy and prosperous once again?\\nThe Iranian regime’s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbours to fight terrorism and halt its financing. In Saudi Arabia, early last year, I was greatly honoured to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agree that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and, indeed, to tear up the entire world.\\nWe must deny terrorists safe haven, transit, funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries that support and finance terror groups, such as Al-Qaida, Hizbullah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people. The United States and its allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush loser terrorists and stop the re-emergence of the safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.\\nLast month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against that evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests — not the arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians — will dictate the length and scope of military operations. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains towards lasting defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many years combined.\\nWe seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honours the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar Al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens, even innocent children, shocked the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the air base that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in the areas liberated from ISIS. We especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars to help support that effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help those horribly treated and enable their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to host countries in the region and we support the recent agreements of the Group of 20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.\\nThat is the safe, responsible and humanitarian approach. For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries. For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reforms and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms. For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and Government.\\nI want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations- and the African Union-led peacekeeping missions have made invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa.\\nThe United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programmes like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the President’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Health Security Agenda, the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which is part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.\\nWe also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity. Too often the focus of the Organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, States that seek to subvert this institution’s noble ends have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some Governments with egregious human rights records sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council.\\nThe United States is one of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 per cent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.\\nMajor portions of the world are in conflict, and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this Hall, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden — militarily or financially.\\nNations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. That is why, in the western hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My Administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban Government until it makes fundamental reforms.\\nWe have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro Moros has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.\\nThe Venezuelan people are starving, and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable, and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbour and friend, we, together with all others, have a goal: to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.\\nI would like to thank leaders in this Hall for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the Government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.\\nWe are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our peoples and all of our neighbours. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.\\nThe problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of those discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under those cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.\\nAll people deserve a Government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity. In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but that trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules, and our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind. But they are forgotten no more, and they will never be forgotten again.\\nWhile America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every Government: the duty to our citizens. This bond is the source of America’s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. If the Organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its Members. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.\\nIn remembering the great victory that led to this body’s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they love. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies. We cannot do it.\\nWe must solve our problems to build our prosperity, to secure our future, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one: are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?\\nOne of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.\\nNow we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humankind and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and a world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all, a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.\\nSo let this be our mission and let this be our message to the world: we will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humankind and for the Almighty God who made us all.\\nGod bless the nations of the world and God bless the United States of America.'"

Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \\nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \\n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \\ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \\nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \\nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \\nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \\nother. \\nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \\nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \\nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \\nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's \\nThe President returned to the Chair. \\n\\n\\\"broad, sunlit uplands\\\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \\nchillingly wrote, \\\"Darkness at Noon\\\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \\nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \\nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \\nbecame conflict's captive. \\nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \\nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \\nwar's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \\nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \\ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \\nbanished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \\ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \\nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \\nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \\nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \\nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \\nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \\ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \\nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \\nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \\nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \\ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \\nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \\n\\nWith the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \\nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \\ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \\nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \\nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \\nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \\nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \\ncommunity. \\nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \\nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \\npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \\nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \\nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \\nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \\nconflict and war. \\nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \\nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \\ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \\nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and \\npreventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \\neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \\ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \\nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \\nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \\nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \\ninternational peace and order. \\n\\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \\nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \\neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \\nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \\nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \\nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \\nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \\nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \\npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \\n \\nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \\npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \\nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \\nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \\nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \\nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \\ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \\nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \\nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \\ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \\npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \\nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \\nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \\nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \\npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \\nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \\nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \\nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \\ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \\nin communism's catacomb. \\nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \\ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \\ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \\nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \\nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \\ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \\n \\nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \\norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \\nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \\na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \\nEurasia, but across the globe. \\nI welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the \\nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \\nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \\nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \\nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \\nSecretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \\nareas. \\nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \\nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \\npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \\nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \\nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \\nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \\ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \\na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \\ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \\nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \\nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \\n\\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \\norganizations. \\nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \\npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \\nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \\nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \\ncrisis. \\nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \\nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \\nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \\nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \\nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \\nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \\nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \\npeace-keeping. \\nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \\naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \\nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \\ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \\npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for \\nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \\nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \\nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \\nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \\nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \\njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \\npeace-keeping operations. \\n\\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \\nplay a part. \\nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \\ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \\npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \\narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \\nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \\ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \\nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \\nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \\nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \\nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \\nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \\nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \\noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \\nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \\nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \\nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \\nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \\nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \\nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \\nsecurity in this new era. \\nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \\ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \\n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \\n \\nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \\nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \\nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \\nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \\n\\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \\nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \\nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \\nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \\nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \\nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \\nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \\nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \\nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \\nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \\nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \\\"clubs\\\", the nuclear-suppliers \\ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \\nNations specialized agencies. \\nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \\nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \\nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \\nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \\nour non-proliferation goals. \\nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \\nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \\nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \\nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \\ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \\n\\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \\njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \\nagenda. \\nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \\nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \\ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \\ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \\nother nations participate in this global protection system. \\nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \\nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \\ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \\ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \\nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \\npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \\nthis new era. \\nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \\nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \\nI affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and \\nenhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \\nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \\nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \\nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \\nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \\neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \\nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \\n\\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \\nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \\nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \\nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \\nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \\nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \\nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \\nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \\ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \\nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \\nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \\nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \\nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \\nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \\nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \\nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \\nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \\nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \\nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \\ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \\nbetter a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \\nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \\npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \\nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \\n\\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \\nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \\nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \\nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \\nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \\nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \\nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \\nreform. \\nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \\nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \\nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \\nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \\ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \\nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \\ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \\nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \\nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \\nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \\nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \\npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \\nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \\nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \\nend one era and begin another. \\nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \\nthrough greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. \\n\\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \\nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \\nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \\nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \\ncommunity of democratic nations. \\n\\nAnd in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was \\nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \\neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \\ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \\nanything at all that appears new and different. \\nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall \\nbecause we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so \\ninterconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, \\nthat to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and \\ndefeat. \\nAt the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more \\nsecure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children \\nand our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war \\nand for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive \\neven during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future \\nreal, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United \\nNations. \\nThank you and may God bless you all. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"47\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1992\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Forty seven years ago I was a young man of 21, and, like thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep freedom alive.

A great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no other. But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill The President returned to the Chair. broad, sunlit uplands, millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so chillingly wrote, Darkness at Noon. Instead of uniting the nations, this body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself became conflict captive. I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold war hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super Powers has vanished, and we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the generation before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super Power stand off that risked nuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other independent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. With the cold war end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge instead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and free markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global community. United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and conflict and war. As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty first century. First, we face the political challenge of keeping today peace and preventing tomorrow wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace keeping capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to international peace and order. Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for all, of strengthening an open, growth oriented, free market international economic order while safeguarding the environment. Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty first century peace.  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: peace keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. Let me begin with peace keeping. The United Nations has a long and distinguished history of peace keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening peace keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. Peace keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive peace keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts   may become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen in communism catacomb. Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new democratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and  Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , the Western European Union , the Commonwealth of Independent States  and other competent regional organizations to develop peace keeping capabilities. We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and Eurasia, but across the globe. I welcome the Secretary General call for a new agenda to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Secretary General proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key areas. First, robust peace keeping requires men and equipment that only Member States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for possible peace keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train together. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have a long history of peace keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also require coordinated command and control and inter operability of both equipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional organizations. Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including famines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a crisis. Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and intelligence capabilities for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations and associated peace keeping efforts. As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international peace keeping. For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace keeping. I have directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on peace keeping. Because of peace keeping growing importance as a mission for the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering and logistical units for the full range of peace keeping and humanitarian activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to support peace keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint peace keeping operations. There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will play a part. Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of their troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate peace keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace arises or when people in need look to the world for help. I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace keeping curriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and operations for peace keeping, and we will also broaden American support for monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United Nations peace keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace keeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United Nations peace keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era. While the cold war may have ended, the super Power nuclear arms competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over 20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and unstable nuclear stand offs to develop around the world. We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for non proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the non nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, in accordance with the Charter, to any any non nuclear weapon State party to the non proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non proliferation Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can strengthen linkages between the suppliers clubs, the nuclear suppliers group, the Australia Group, the missile technology control regime and United Nations specialized agencies. Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations Special Commission  to dismantle the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy Agency . But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance our non proliferation goals. In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  to refocus its talents on providing technical support for non proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA should be used not only in completing the traditional arms control agenda but, just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security agenda. Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already taking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have other nations participate in this global protection system. While expanded peace keeping capabilities and improved non proliferation efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic growth is the long term foundation for a brighter future well into the next century. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for this new era. At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven  coordination process, and I affirmed America support for a European integration that opens markets and enhances Europe capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for Europeans to determine, we will stand by them. Economic growth is not a zero sum process. All of us will benefit from the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as soon as possible, and to create a network of free trade agreements, beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared responsibility to foster and support the free market reforms necessary to build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with traditional Government to Government foreign aid. After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon in the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign assistance funds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those suffering from man made and natural disasters. But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the better a country investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. To move from what I would call aid dependency to economic partnership, we propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become contributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our Congress I will propose a top to bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that has built up around Government based programmes, streamlining our delivery systems and strengthening support for private sector development and economic reform. The Agency for International Development , another institution born during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be charity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, using existing foreign affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring. I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the Export Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology promote investment in world wide economic growth. The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G 7 nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we end one era and begin another. None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, through greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global community of democratic nations. And in the face of today changes, with the loss of so much that was familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against anything at all that appears new and different. As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and defeat. At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom flame alive even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United Nations. Thank you and may God bless you all. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'It is my honour to address the Assembly for the first time as the forty fourth President of the United States. I come before you humbled by the responsibility that the American people have placed upon me, mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history and determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and abroad.  I have been in office for just nine months, though some days it seems a lot longer. I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world. Those expectations are not about me. Rather they are, I believe, rooted in a discontent with the status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences and outpaced by our problems. But they are also rooted in hope — the hope that real change is possible and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.  I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with scepticism and distrust. A part of that was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues America had acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. That has fed an almost reflexive anti Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.  Like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the interests of my nation and my people, and I will never apologize for defending those interests. But it is my deeply held belief that in the year 2009, more than at any point in human history, the interests of nations and peoples are shared. The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people, or they can tear us apart. The technology we harness can light the path to peace, or forever darken it. The energy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it. What happens to the hope of a single child, anywhere, can enrich our world, or impoverish it.  In this Hall, we come from many places, but we share a common future. No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together. I have carried this message from London to Ankara, from Port of Spain to Moscow, from Accra to Cairo, and it is what I will speak about today.  Because the time has come for the world to move in a new direction, we must embrace a new era of engagement based on mutual interests and mutual respect, and our work must begin now. We know the future will be forged by deeds, and not simply words. Speeches alone will not solve our problems. It will take persistent action.  So for those who question the character and cause of my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete actions we have taken in just nine months.  On my first day in office I prohibited, without exception or equivocation, the use of torture by the United States of America. I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law.  Every nation must know that America will live its values, and we will lead by example. We have set a clear and focused goal to work with all members of this body to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and its extremist allies — a network that has killed thousands of people of many faiths and nations and has plotted to blow up this very building. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we and many nations here are helping those Governments to develop the capacity to take the lead in this effort, while working to advance opportunity and security for their people.  In Iraq we are responsibly ending a war. We have removed American combat brigades from Iraqi cities and set a deadline of next August to remove all our combat brigades from Iraqi territory. I have made clear that we will help Iraqis make the transition to full responsibility for their future and keep our commitment to remove all American troops by the end of 2011.  I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In Moscow, the United States and Russia announced that we would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic warheads and launchers. In the Conference on Disarmament we agreed on a workplan to negotiate an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. And this week, my Secretary of State will become the first senior American representative to the    09 52179 10  annual members’ conference of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Upon taking office, I appointed a special envoy for Middle East peace, and America has worked steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two States — Israel and Palestine — in which peace and security take root and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians are respected.  To confront climate change we have invested $80 billion in clean energy. We have substantially increased our fuel efficiency standards. We have provided new incentives for conservation, launched an energy partnership across the Americas and moved from being a bystander to being a leader in international climate negotiations.  To overcome an economic crisis that touches every corner of the world, we worked with the Group of 20 nations to forge a coordinated international response of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the global economy back from the brink. We mobilized resources that help prevent the crisis from spreading further to developing countries, and we joined with others to launch a $20 billion global food security initiative that will lend a hand to those who need it most and help them build their own capacity.  We have also re engaged the United Nations. We have paid our bills. We have joined the Human Rights Council. We have signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We have fully embraced the Millennium Development Goals, and we address our priorities here in this institution, for instance through the Security Council meeting on nuclear non proliferation and disarmament that I will chair tomorrow and through the issues that I will discuss today.  That is what we have already done, but it is just a beginning. Some of our actions have yielded progress; some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future. But make no mistake: this cannot solely be America’s endeavour. Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world’s problems alone. We have sought, in word and deed, a new era of engagement with the world, and now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.  If we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit that we are not living up to that responsibility. Consider the course that we are on if we fail to confront the status quo: extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world, protracted conflicts that grind on and on, genocide, mass atrocities, more nations with nuclear weapons, melting ice caps and ravaged populations, persistent poverty and pandemic disease.  I say this not to sow fear, but to state a fact. The magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions. This body was founded on the belief that the nations of the world could solve their problems together. Franklin Roosevelt, who died before he could see his vision for this institution become a reality, put it this way:  “The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man, or one party, or one nation. It cannot be a peace of large nations or of small nations. It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.”  The cooperative effort of the whole world — those words ring even more true today when it is not simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that we hold in common. Yet, we also know that this body is made up of sovereign States and that, sadly but not surprisingly, this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground, a venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems. After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point fingers and stoke divisions. Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions. Anybody can do that. Responsibility and leadership in the twenty first century demand more.  In an era when our destiny is shared, power is no longer a zero sum game. No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation. No world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed. No balance of power among nations will hold. The traditional divisions between nations of the South and the North make no sense in an interconnected world, nor do alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long gone cold war.  The time has come to realize that the old habits and the old arguments are irrelevant to the challenges faced by our peoples. They leave nations to act in opposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue and to vote, often in this body, against the interests of their own people. They build up walls between us and   11 09 52179  the future that our peoples seek, and the time has come for those walls to come down. Together we must build new coalitions that bridge old divides — coalitions of different faiths and creeds, of North and South, East, West, black, white and brown.  The choice is ours. We can be remembered as the generation that chose to drag the arguments of the twentieth century into the twenty first, and that put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, and failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were against instead of what we were for; or we can be a generation that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead, that comes together to serve the common interests of human beings, and finally gives meaning to the promise imbedded in the name given to this institution — the United Nations. That is the future America wants — a future of peace and prosperity that we can reach only if we recognize that all nations have rights. But all nations have responsibilities as well. That is the bargain that makes this work. That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.  Today, let me put forward four pillars that I believe are fundamental to the future that we want for our children: non proliferation and disarmament, the promotion of peace and security, the preservation of our planet, and a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.  First, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the goal of a world without them. This institution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age in part because man’s capacity to kill had to be contained. For decades, we averted disaster, even under the shadow of a super Power stand off. But today the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity. If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear arms races in every region and the prospect of wars and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine.  A fragile consensus stands in the way of this frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that shapes the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . It says that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy, and that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move towards disarmament and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them. The next 12 months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve.  America intends to keep our end of the bargain. We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launches. We will move forward with ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and work with others to bring the Treaty into force, so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited. We will complete a nuclear posture review that opens the door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons, and we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for weapons.  I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms each nation’s responsibility to secure nuclear material on its territory and to help those who cannot, because we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a violent extremist. And we will work to strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.  All of this must support efforts to strengthen the NPT. Those nations that refuse to live up to their obligations must face consequences. Let me be clear: This is not about singling out individual nations. It is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities, because a world in which International Atomic Energy Agency inspections are avoided and the United Nations demands are ignored will leave all people less safe and all nations less secure.  In their actions to date, the Governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope. We respect their rights as members of the community of nations. I have said before and I will repeat: I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations. But if the Governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East, then they must be held accountable. The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise and that treaties will be enforced. We must insist that the future does not belong to fear.  That brings me to the second pillar for our future: the pursuit of peace. The United Nations was born of    09 52179 12  the belief that the people of the world can live their lives, raise their families and resolve their differences peacefully. Yet we know that in too many parts of the world this ideal remains an abstraction — a distant dream. We can either accept that outcome as inevitable and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world. That effort must begin with an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men, women and children will never be tolerated. On this, there can be no dispute.  The violent extremists who promote conflict by distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves. They offer nothing but hatred and destruction. In confronting them, America will forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share intelligence, coordinate law enforcement and protect our people. We will permit no safe haven for Al Qaida to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation. We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we and many nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow. And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths and new partnerships for opportunity.  Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists, for the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings — the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin. And that is why we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take hold.   We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan, through support for the people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve.  And in countries ravaged by violence, from Haiti to Congo to East Timor, we will work with the United Nations and other partners to support an enduring peace.  I will also continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine and the Arab world. We will continue to work on that issue. Yesterday I had a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We have made some progress. Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians. As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow.  But more progress is needed. We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel. And we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.  The time has come to re launch negotiations — without preconditions — that address the permanent status issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees and Jerusalem. The goal is clear: two States living side by side in peace and security: a Jewish State of Israel, with true security for all Israelis, and a viable, independent Palestinian State with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people. As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbours. In pursuit of that goal, we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral participation, alongside bilateral negotiations.  Now, I am not naive. I know this will be difficult. But all of us — not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us — must decide whether we are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it lip service. To break the old patterns — to break the cycle of insecurity and despair — all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in private. The United States does Israel no favours when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favours when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over a constructive willingness to recognize Israel’s legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security.  We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It is not paid by politicians. It is paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It is paid by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own. These are all God’s children. And after all the politics and all the posturing, this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security. That is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of Earth the Holy Land. And that is why —   13 09 52179  even though there will be setbacks, and false starts, and tough days — I will not waiver in my pursuit of peace.  Thirdly, we must recognize that in the twenty first century there will be no peace unless we take responsibility for the preservation of our planet. And I thank the Secretary General for hosting the summit on climate change yesterday.  The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred. If we continue down our current course, every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within its borders. Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources. Development will be devastated by drought and famine. Land that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear. Future generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act — why we failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of our inheritance.  And that is why the days when America dragged its feet on this issue are over. We will move forward with investments to transform our energy economy, while providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of energy. We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050. We will continue to promote renewable energy and efficiency — and share new technologies — with countries around the world. And we will seize every opportunity for progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire world.  Those wealthy nations that did so much damage to the environment in the twentieth century must accept our obligation to lead. But responsibility does not end there. While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast growing carbon emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without inhibiting growth. And any effort that fails both to help the poorest nations to adapt to the problems that climate change has already wrought and to help them travel a path of clean development simply will not work.  It is hard to change something as fundamental as how we use energy. I know that. It is even harder to do so in the midst of a global recession. Certainly, it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first. But we cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together. As we head into Copenhagen, let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for the sake of our common future.  This leads me to the final pillar that must fortify our future: a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.  The world is still recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In America, we see the engine of growth beginning to churn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay their bills. Across the globe, we find promising signs, but little certainty about what lies ahead. And far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises that challenge our humanity: the despair of an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a treatable disease or a mother losing her life as she gives birth.  In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world’s largest economies to chart a course for growth that is balanced and sustained. That means vigilance to ensure that we do not let up until our people are back to work. That means taking steps to rekindle demand, so that global recovery can be sustained. And that means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all financial centres, so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.  At a time of such interdependence, we have a moral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader questions of development: the questions of development that existed even before this crisis happened. And so America will continue our historic effort to help people feed themselves. We have set aside $63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio and to strengthen public health systems. We are joining with other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization. We will integrate more economies into a system of global trade. We will support the Millennium Development Goals and approach next year’s summit with a global plan to make them a reality. And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.  Now is the time for all of us to do our part. Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all nations embrace their responsibilities. That means that    09 52179 14  wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those with less, while reforming international institutions to give more nations a greater voice. And developing nations must root out the corruption that is an obstacle to progress, for opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are oppressed and businesses have to pay bribes. That is why we will support honest police and independent judges, civil society and a vibrant private sector. Our goal is simple: a global economy in which growth is sustained and opportunity is available to all.  Now, the changes that I have spoken about today will not be easy to make, and they will not be realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this, as useful as that may be. For, as in any assembly of members, real change can only come through the people we represent. That is why we must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own capitals. That is where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use energy and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.  I believe that the people of the world want this future for their children. And that is why we must champion those principles that ensure that Governments reflect the will of the people. These principles cannot be afterthoughts. Democracy and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I have discussed today, because Governments of the people and by the people are more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people, rather than the narrow interest of those in power.  The test of our leadership will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our people. True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle dissent or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home. The people of the world want change. They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.  This Organization’s Charter commits each of us “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women”.  Among those rights is the freedom to speak your mind and worship as you please, the promise of equality of the races and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own potential, and the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are governed and to have confidence in the administration of justice. For, just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another nation, no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their own people.  As an African American, I will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a more perfect union in my country. That guides my belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, transformative change can be forged by those who choose to side with justice. And I pledge that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity and their rights — for the student who seeks to learn, the voter who demands to be heard, the innocent who longs to be free and the oppressed who yearns to be equal.  Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions. And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy. But that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it. There are basic principles that are universal. There are certain truths that are self evident, and the United States of America will never waiver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny.  Sixty five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth, and final, inaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum up the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible suffering and enormous sacrifice that had taken place. We have learned, he said, to be citizens of the world, members of the human community. The United Nations was built by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world — from Africa and Asia, from Europe to the Americas. These architects of international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but naive. It was rooted in the hard earned lessons of war, rooted in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of splitting apart.  Now it falls to us, for this institution will be what we make of it. The United Nations does extraordinary good around the world, in feeding the hungry, caring for the sick and mending places that have been broken.   15 09 52179  But it also struggles to enforce its will and to live up to the ideals of its founding. I believe that those imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution; they are a calling to redouble our efforts. The United Nations can be a place where we either bicker about outdated grievances or forge common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart or what brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny or a source of moral authority. In short, the United Nations can be an institution that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens or it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the people we serve.  We have reached a pivotal moment. The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation, one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations. And so, with confidence in our cause and with a commitment to our values, we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people so richly deserve.'"

Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \\nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \\n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \\ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \\nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \\nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \\nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \\nother. \\nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \\nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \\nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \\nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's \\nThe President returned to the Chair. \\n\\n\\\"broad, sunlit uplands\\\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \\nchillingly wrote, \\\"Darkness at Noon\\\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \\nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \\nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \\nbecame conflict's captive. \\nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \\nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \\nwar's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \\nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \\ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \\nbanished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \\ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \\nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \\nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \\nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \\nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \\nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \\ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \\nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \\nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \\nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \\ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \\nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \\n\\nWith the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \\nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \\ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \\nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \\nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \\nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \\nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \\ncommunity. \\nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \\nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \\npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \\nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \\nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \\nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \\nconflict and war. \\nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \\nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \\ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \\nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and \\npreventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \\neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \\ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \\nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \\nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \\nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \\ninternational peace and order. \\n\\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \\nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \\neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \\nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \\nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \\nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \\nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \\nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \\npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \\n \\nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \\npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \\nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \\nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \\nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \\nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \\ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \\nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \\nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \\ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \\npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \\nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \\nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \\nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \\npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \\nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \\nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \\nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \\ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \\nin communism's catacomb. \\nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \\ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \\ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \\nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \\nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \\ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \\n \\nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \\norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \\nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \\na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \\nEurasia, but across the globe. \\nI welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the \\nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \\nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \\nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \\nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \\nSecretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \\nareas. \\nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \\nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \\npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \\nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \\nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \\nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \\ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \\na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \\ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \\nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \\nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \\n\\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \\norganizations. \\nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \\npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \\nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \\nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \\ncrisis. \\nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \\nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \\nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \\nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \\nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \\nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \\nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \\npeace-keeping. \\nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \\naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \\nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \\ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \\npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for \\nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \\nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \\nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \\nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \\nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \\njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \\npeace-keeping operations. \\n\\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \\nplay a part. \\nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \\ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \\npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \\narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \\nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \\ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \\nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \\nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \\nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \\nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \\nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \\nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \\noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \\nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \\nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \\nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \\nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \\nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \\nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \\nsecurity in this new era. \\nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \\ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \\n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \\n \\nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \\nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \\nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \\nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \\n\\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \\nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \\nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \\nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \\nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \\nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \\nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \\nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \\nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \\nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \\nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \\\"clubs\\\", the nuclear-suppliers \\ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \\nNations specialized agencies. \\nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \\nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \\nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \\nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \\nour non-proliferation goals. \\nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \\nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \\nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \\nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \\ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \\n\\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \\njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \\nagenda. \\nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \\nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \\ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \\ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \\nother nations participate in this global protection system. \\nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \\nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \\ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \\ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \\nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \\npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \\nthis new era. \\nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \\nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \\nI affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and \\nenhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \\nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \\nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \\nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \\nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \\neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \\nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \\n\\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \\nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \\nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \\nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \\nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \\nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \\nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \\nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \\ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \\nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \\nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \\nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \\nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \\nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \\nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \\nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \\nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \\nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \\nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \\ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \\nbetter a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \\nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \\npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \\nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \\n\\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \\nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \\nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \\nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \\nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \\nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \\nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \\nreform. \\nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \\nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \\nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \\nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \\ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \\nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \\ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \\nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \\nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \\nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \\nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \\npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \\nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \\nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \\nend one era and begin another. \\nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \\nthrough greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. \\n\\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \\nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \\nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \\nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \\ncommunity of democratic nations. \\n\\nAnd in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was \\nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \\neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \\ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \\nanything at all that appears new and different. \\nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall \\nbecause we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so \\ninterconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, \\nthat to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and \\ndefeat. \\nAt the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more \\nsecure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children \\nand our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war \\nand for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive \\neven during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future \\nreal, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United \\nNations. \\nThank you and may God bless you all. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"47\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1992\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Forty seven years ago I was a young man of 21, and, like thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep freedom alive. Forty seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: 1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no other. But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill The President returned to the Chair. broad, sunlit uplands, millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so chillingly wrote, Darkness at Noon. Instead of uniting the nations, this body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself became conflict captive. I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold war hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super Powers has vanished, and we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the generation before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super Power stand off that risked nuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other independent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. With the cold war end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge instead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and free markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global community. United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and conflict and war. As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty first century. First, we face the political challenge of keeping today peace and preventing tomorrow wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace keeping capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to international peace and order. Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for all, of strengthening an open, growth oriented, free market international economic order while safeguarding the environment. Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty first century peace.  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: peace keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. Let me begin with peace keeping. The United Nations has a long and distinguished history of peace keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening peace keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. Peace keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive peace keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts   may become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen in communism catacomb. Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new democratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and  Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , the Western European Union , the Commonwealth of Independent States  and other competent regional organizations to develop peace keeping capabilities. We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and Eurasia, but across the globe. I welcome the Secretary General call for a new agenda to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Secretary General proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key areas. First, robust peace keeping requires men and equipment that only Member States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for possible peace keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train together. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have a long history of peace keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also require coordinated command and control and inter operability of both equipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional organizations. Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including famines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a crisis. Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and intelligence capabilities for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations and associated peace keeping efforts. As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international peace keeping. For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace keeping. I have directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on peace keeping. Because of peace keeping growing importance as a mission for the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering and logistical units for the full range of peace keeping and humanitarian activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to support peace keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint peace keeping operations. There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will play a part. Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of their troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate peace keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace arises or when people in need look to the world for help. I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace keeping curriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and operations for peace keeping, and we will also broaden American support for monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United Nations peace keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace keeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United Nations peace keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era. While the cold war may have ended, the super Power nuclear arms competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over 20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and unstable nuclear stand offs to develop around the world. We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for non proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the non nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, in accordance with the Charter, to any any non nuclear weapon State party to the non proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non proliferation Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can strengthen linkages between the suppliers clubs, the nuclear suppliers group, the Australia Group, the missile technology control regime and United Nations specialized agencies. Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations Special Commission  to dismantle the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy Agency . But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance our non proliferation goals. In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  to refocus its talents on providing technical support for non proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA should be used not only in completing the traditional arms control agenda but, just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security agenda. Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already taking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have other nations participate in this global protection system. While expanded peace keeping capabilities and improved non proliferation efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic growth is the long term foundation for a brighter future well into the next century. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for this new era. At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven  coordination process, and I affirmed America support for a European integration that opens markets and enhances Europe capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for Europeans to determine, we will stand by them. Economic growth is not a zero sum process. All of us will benefit from the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as soon as possible, and to create a network of free trade agreements, beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared responsibility to foster and support the free market reforms necessary to build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with traditional Government to Government foreign aid. After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon in the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign assistance funds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those suffering from man made and natural disasters. But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the better a country investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. To move from what I would call aid dependency to economic partnership, we propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become contributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our Congress I will propose a top to bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that has built up around Government based programmes, streamlining our delivery systems and strengthening support for private sector development and economic reform. The Agency for International Development , another institution born during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be charity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, using existing foreign affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring. I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the Export Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology promote investment in world wide economic growth. The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G 7 nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we end one era and begin another. None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, through greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global community of democratic nations. And in the face of today changes, with the loss of so much that was familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against anything at all that appears new and different. As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and defeat. At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom flame alive even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United Nations.

Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \\nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \\n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \\ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \\nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \\nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \\nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \\nother. \\nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \\nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \\nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \\nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's \\nThe President returned to the Chair. \\n\\n\\\"broad, sunlit uplands\\\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \\nchillingly wrote, \\\"Darkness at Noon\\\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \\nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \\nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \\nbecame conflict's captive. \\nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \\nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \\nwar's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \\nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \\ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \\nbanished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \\ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \\nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \\nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \\nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \\nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \\nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \\ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \\nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \\nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \\nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \\ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \\nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \\n\\nWith the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \\nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \\ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \\nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \\nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \\nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \\nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \\ncommunity. \\nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \\nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \\npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \\nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \\nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \\nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \\nconflict and war. \\nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \\nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \\ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \\nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and \\npreventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \\neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \\ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \\nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \\nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \\nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \\ninternational peace and order. \\n\\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \\nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \\neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \\nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \\nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \\nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \\nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \\nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \\npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \\n \\nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \\npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \\nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \\nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \\nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \\nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \\ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \\nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \\nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \\ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \\npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \\nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \\nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \\nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \\npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \\nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \\nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \\nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \\ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \\nin communism's catacomb. \\nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \\ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \\ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \\nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \\nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \\ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \\n \\nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \\norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \\nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \\na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \\nEurasia, but across the globe. \\nI welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the \\nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \\nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \\nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \\nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \\nSecretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \\nareas. \\nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \\nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \\npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \\nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \\nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \\nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \\ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \\na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \\ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \\nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \\nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \\n\\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \\norganizations. \\nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \\npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \\nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \\nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \\ncrisis. \\nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \\nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \\nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \\nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \\nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \\nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \\nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \\npeace-keeping. \\nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \\naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \\nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \\ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \\npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for \\nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \\nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \\nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \\nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \\nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \\njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \\npeace-keeping operations. \\n\\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \\nplay a part. \\nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \\ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \\npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \\narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \\nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \\ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \\nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \\nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \\nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \\nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \\nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \\nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \\noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \\nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \\nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \\nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \\nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \\nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \\nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \\nsecurity in this new era. \\nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \\ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \\n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \\n \\nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \\nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \\nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \\nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \\n\\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \\nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \\nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \\nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \\nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \\nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \\nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \\nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \\nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \\nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \\nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \\\"clubs\\\", the nuclear-suppliers \\ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \\nNations specialized agencies. \\nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \\nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \\nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \\nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \\nour non-proliferation goals. \\nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \\nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \\nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \\nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \\ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \\n\\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \\njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \\nagenda. \\nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \\nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \\ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \\ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \\nother nations participate in this global protection system. \\nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \\nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \\ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \\ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \\nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \\npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \\nthis new era. \\nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \\nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \\nI affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and \\nenhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \\nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \\nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \\nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \\nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \\neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \\nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \\n\\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \\nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \\nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \\nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \\nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \\nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \\nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \\nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \\ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \\nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \\nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \\nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \\nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \\nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \\nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \\nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \\nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \\nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \\nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \\ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \\nbetter a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \\nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \\npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \\nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \\n\\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \\nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \\nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \\nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \\nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \\nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \\nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \\nreform. \\nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \\nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \\nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \\nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \\ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \\nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \\ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \\nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \\nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \\nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \\nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \\npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \\nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \\nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \\nend one era and begin another. \\nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \\nthrough greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. \\n\\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \\nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \\nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \\nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \\ncommunity of democratic nations. \\n\\nAnd in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was \\nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \\neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \\ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \\nanything at all that appears new and different. \\nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall \\nbecause we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so \\ninterconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, \\nthat to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and \\ndefeat. \\nAt the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more \\nsecure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children \\nand our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war \\nand for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive \\neven during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future \\nreal, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United \\nNations. \\nThank you and may God bless you all. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"47\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1992\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Forty seven years ago I was a young man of 21, and, like thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep freedom alive. Forty seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: 1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no other. But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill The President returned to the Chair. broad, sunlit uplands, millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so chillingly wrote, Darkness at Noon. Instead of uniting the nations, this body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself became conflict captive. I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold war hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super Powers has vanished, and we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the generation before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super Power stand off that risked nuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other independent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. With the cold war end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge instead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and free markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global community. United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and conflict and war. As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty first century. First, we face the political challenge of keeping today peace and preventing tomorrow wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace keeping capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to international peace and order. Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for all, of strengthening an open, growth oriented, free market international economic order while safeguarding the environment. Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty first century peace.  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: peace keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. Let me begin with peace keeping. The United Nations has a long and distinguished history of peace keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening peace keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. Peace keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive peace keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts   may become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen in communism catacomb. Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new democratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and  Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , the Western European Union , the Commonwealth of Independent States  and other competent regional organizations to develop peace keeping capabilities. We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and Eurasia, but across the globe. I welcome the Secretary General call for a new agenda to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Secretary General proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key areas. First, robust peace keeping requires men and equipment that only Member States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for possible peace keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train together. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have a long history of peace keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also require coordinated command and control and inter operability of both equipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional organizations. Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including famines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a crisis. Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and intelligence capabilities for peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations and associated peace keeping efforts. As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international peace keeping. For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace keeping. I have directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on peace keeping. Because of peace keeping growing importance as a mission for the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering and logistical units for the full range of peace keeping and humanitarian activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to support peace keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint peace keeping operations. There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will play a part. Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of their troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate peace keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace arises or when people in need look to the world for help. I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace keeping curriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and operations for peace keeping, and we will also broaden American support for monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United Nations peace keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace keeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United Nations peace keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era. While the cold war may have ended, the super Power nuclear arms competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over 20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and unstable nuclear stand offs to develop around the world. We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for non proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the non nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, in accordance with the Charter, to any any non nuclear weapon State party to the non proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non proliferation Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can strengthen linkages between the suppliers clubs, the nuclear suppliers group, the Australia Group, the missile technology control regime and United Nations specialized agencies. Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations Special Commission  to dismantle the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy Agency . But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance our non proliferation goals. In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  to refocus its talents on providing technical support for non proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA should be used not only in completing the traditional arms control agenda but, just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security agenda. Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already taking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have other nations participate in this global protection system. While expanded peace keeping capabilities and improved non proliferation efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic growth is the long term foundation for a brighter future well into the next century. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for this new era. At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven  coordination process, and I affirmed America support for a European integration that opens markets and enhances Europe capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for Europeans to determine, we will stand by them. Economic growth is not a zero sum process. All of us will benefit from the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as soon as possible, and to create a network of free trade agreements, beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared responsibility to foster and support the free market reforms necessary to build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with traditional Government to Government foreign aid. After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon in the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign assistance funds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those suffering from man made and natural disasters. But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the better a country investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. To move from what I would call aid dependency to economic partnership, we propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become contributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our Congress I will propose a top to bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that has built up around Government based programmes, streamlining our delivery systems and strengthening support for private sector development and economic reform. The Agency for International Development , another institution born during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be charity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, using existing foreign affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring. I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the Export Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology promote investment in world wide economic growth. The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G 7 nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we end one era and begin another. None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, through greater coordinated action, to building \\u00ac\\u00a3 stronger world economy. I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global community of democratic nations. And in the face of today changes, with the loss of so much that was familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against anything at all that appears new and different. As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and defeat. At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom flame alive even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United Nations.
